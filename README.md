# Maze Game
## Introduction

The Maze game is an interactive user controlled game that requires the player to complete a series of maze challenges within a 3-life span.
There is a maze floor that holds two servos, maze interface support, and an opening for the ball to rest. The maze interface has built-in wooden
walls and barriers for the player to navigate their way towards the goal. The servo tilts the maze interface in either x or y direction. 
The servos are controlled by an accelerometer which is embedded in a 3d printed controller. Player can tilt the controller in either direction
to control the tilt angle on the maze
